Hacksgiving is an all-night hackathon just before the Thanksgiving break. At
[Lookout](http://hackers.lookout.com), Hacksgiving is a time for the entire
company to come up with new ideas, form teams, and create some great new
products!

Hacksgiving at other companies might look slightly different, but this is what
it means for us.


#### Prior to the event

Before Hacksgiving starts, rolling whiteboards are set aside for "pitching"
ideas. This generally means:

* One-line explanation/elevator-pitch of an idea
* Name of the author(s) who plan on working on the project
* (*optional*) Needs or requests for help from people (e.g. "front-end dev
  needed")

Leading up to the event, other people will add "+1" (or in some cases "+1000")
to ideas they really like, or want to see built. This is a useful encouragement
for the members of the project, letting them know how excited their coworkers
are to see the idea built!

Shortly before Hacksgiving, a couple "workshops" will also be held to introduce
toolkits to people who want to hack on something outside of their domain of
expertise. This means marketing people might learn how to build Android apps,
or Ops people might learn how to build things for iOS, etc.

#### During the event

During Hacksgiving, Lookout will cater a number of meals and snacks to make
sure that everybody can focus on building a kick-ass prototype in **24 hours**.

Generally what will happen is teams will spread out across the office, mostly
congregating where music is playing, and food is readily available. People tend
to congregate together to "riff" off one another and get feedback from people
outside of their immediate team.

Hacksgiving is a company-wide event, and even one-person teams are encouraged
to bounce ideas and demos off their fellow hackers.


#### Ending the event

At the end of the event, it'll be time for another meal (lunch) and some demos!

The combination of adrenaline, sleep deprivation and eagerness to show off what
you've built makes for an extremely fun show-and-tell session that ends
Hacksgiving.

Immediately following demos, we'll vote on the coolest projects, and those
teams will receive a **top secret** special gift.
