Lookout will be hosting a 24 hour Hacksgiving event from November 19th into Nov. 20th
2012 at Lookout HQ in San Francisco.

The hackathon checklist is looking pretty complete:

---

&#x2611; Brainstorm tons of project ideas (3 rolling whiteboards, front and
back!)

&#x2611; Order great (top-secret!) prizes

&#x2611; Set up catering to keep everybody well fed and focused.

&#x2611; Ensure the kegerators are fully stocked

&#x2610; Self-organize into teams

&#x2610; Build things!

---

We'll be posting pictures throughout the event, and posting lots of updates via
the [@LookoutEng](https://twitter.com/LookoutEng) twitter account.
